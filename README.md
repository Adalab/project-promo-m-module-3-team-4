# Final team project during the bootcamp at [Adalab](https://adalab.es/)

##  Using React, we have refactored the code of a functional website intended to produce digital business cards, that was initially created with JavaScript.


The main idea of this project was to learn to `work with legacy code`, something that often happens in the programming world, developing our ability to modify code created by 
others and making us aware of the importance of creating good code.  
## Used Technologies:
- Sass for styling.
- ES6 and React for structuring the application JavaScript.
- Git for version control, using branches.
- Publication on the Internet using GitHub Pages.
In addition, we have implemented the following new features:
- Navigation between the different pages of the application using React router.
- Our own server which creates each individual card and offers the link to share it.
## Steps we followed:
#### :mag: Project analysis 
-  Create a new repo implementing the React project
-  Create, inside such repo, a folder with version 0 (legacy code).
-  Analyse and test the code to understand its structure in order to adapt it to our needs and knowledge.
-  Fix bugs detected in the code.
-  Implement improvements in the legacy code, without modifying the functionality. 
##### 📋 React Layout
-  Define the React component structure of the application.
-  Generate the components of the project and communicate information through props.
-  Create branches to work on the different components and avoid touching the master branch. 
##### ⚛️ React Full version
-  Perform interactivity, using React state and events.
-  Implement communication with the backend, sharing and offline.
-  Implement routing with React router. 
#####  Backend
